Learning Project: A Simple Neural Network to play tic tac toe

The repository has three branches:
- 3x3: defines a simple neural network with one hidden layer to play tic tac toe against a human in a 3x3 board.
- 4x4: defines a simple neural network with one hidden layer to play tic tac toe against a human in a 4x4 board.
- 4x4_one_layer_against_two_layers: defines a simple neural network with one hidden layer and another neural network with two hidden layes and let play against each other in a 4x4 board.
